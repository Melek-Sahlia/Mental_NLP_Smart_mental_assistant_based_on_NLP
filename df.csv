"That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.",surprise
"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?",surprise
"Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.",joy
"So you might say, its a magic ring.",joy
OH MY GOD!! I didnt really believe it until you just said it!!,surprise
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.,neutral
"Obviously! So, how do we decide?",neutral
"Well now lets-lets look at this objectively, I think I should date her",neutral

"Yes, thats very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.",neutral
"Yes, I realize that",neutral
"And Rachel shouldnt have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.",neutral
I love working with designers!,joy
