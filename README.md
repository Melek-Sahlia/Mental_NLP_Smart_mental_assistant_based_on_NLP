Mental health is a growing concern in society, and this project aims to address this by developing a sentiment analysis model that can accurately detect a user's emotional state during a conversation and provide helpful responses. To achieve this, publicly available datasets like MELD and ISEAR were used for data collection. These datasets consist of a large number of conversations and text data with various emotions such as stress, anxiety, and depression. Text preprocessing was performed using the NLTK library in Python to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

Various machine learning algorithms were used to develop the sentiment analysis model, including Naive Bayes, SVM, and LSTM, as well as deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. These models were trained on the cleaned data and optimized for accurate classification of emotions expressed in the text data.

Evaluation of the model was done on a test dataset using different evaluation metrics such as F1 score, confusion matrix, and ROC curve. These metrics helped to measure the accuracy, precision, and recall of the model, providing insights into its performance and possible improvements.

Prerequisites for this project include knowledge of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. NLP is a critical part of this project as it involves the analysis of human language, which is complex and context-dependent. Machine learning is also necessary as it involves the development of algorithms that can learn and improve from data.

In conclusion, this project has developed a sentiment analysis model that can detect a user's emotional state during a conversation and provide helpful responses. The use of publicly available datasets, text preprocessing, and various machine learning algorithms has enabled the development of an accurate and reliable model. The evaluation metrics used have provided insights into the model's performance and possible areas for improvement. The project has highlighted the importance of NLP and machine learning in addressing societal concerns such as mental health.
